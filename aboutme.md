<!-- Research Experience -->

During my undergraduate at Zhejiang University of Technology, I explored a wide range of research area from embeded systems to sparse neural networks. During that time, I tried to explore as much as I can (even earned a minor degree in law) and laid a solid background in Computer Science.

After graduation, I went to East China Normal University for graduate study. Mainly, I worked on data minging and NLP (text generation) to solve practical problems, while publishing some papers. Meahwhile, I also learnt tons of database knowledge, like OLTP(On-Line Transaction Processing), distributed database systems, blockchain and so on. It is really fun to have both system and machine learning perspectives. 

Realizing my deeper interests and passion in ML and AI, I am fortunate to be admitted to William&Mary to work with Prof. Shao for my Ph.D. journey. I think it will be hard but also pretty fun!

Life is more like a journey and exploration. Let's try our best and see what is going on there!:)
