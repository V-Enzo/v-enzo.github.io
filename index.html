        Hi, there! My name is Charles(Xiaochang) Li. I am currently a (2022-x)-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at William&Mary. I am fortunately advised by <a href="https://shj1987.github.io/">Prof. Huajie Shao</a> Prior to the Ph.D. journey, I received my M.S. degree of Data Science from <a href="https://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/main.htm">East China Normal University</a>,Â focusing on Natural Language Processing and Data Mining.

        My research interest focuses on Network Foundation Model and Large Language Model(LLM). My goal is to design practical Network Foundation Models to solve network traffic analysis problems.
        Recently, we worked on both network traffic classification(understanding) tasks and generation tasks (Check our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03646.pdf">LENS</a>) Besides, we have organized a <a href="https://github.com/WM-JayLab/NetBench">network traffic benchmark</a> and will be released soon.
