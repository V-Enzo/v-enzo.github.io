    <p>
        Hi, there! My name is Charles(Xiaochang) Li. I am currently a (2022-x)-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at William&Mary. I am fortunately advised by <a href="https://shj1987.github.io/">Prof. Huajie Shao</a>. Prior to the Ph.D. journey, I received my M.S. degree of Data Science from <a href="https://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/main.htm">East China Normal University</a>, focusing on Natural Language Processing and Data Mining.
    </p>
    <p>
        My research interest focuses on <strong>Network Foundation Model and Large Language Model(LLM)</strong>. My goal is to design practical Network Foundation Models to solve network traffic analysis problems.
  
    </p>
    <p>
        Recently, we worked on both network traffic classification(understanding) tasks and generation tasks (Check our paper <a
        href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03646.pdf">LENS</a>) Besides, we have organized a <a
        href="https://github.com/WM-JayLab/NetBench">network traffic benchmark</a> and will be released soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>!!! I am open to various forms of research collaboration.</strong> I am open to any questions and discussions on ML, NLP and LLM. Feel free to leave any comments or send me an <a href="mailto:xiaochanglilxc@gmail.com">email</a>! Looking forward to hear from you!
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy watching good movies, and listening to music during my spare time. Besides, I like sports, including playing basketball, weight lifting, skiing and so on.
