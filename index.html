    <p>
        Hi, there! My name is Charles(Xiaochang) Li. I am currently a (2022-x)-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at William&Mary. I am fortunately advised by <a href="https://shj1987.github.io/">Prof. Huajie Shao</a>. Prior to the Ph.D. journey, I received my M.S. degree of Data Science from <a href="https://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/main.htm">East China Normal University</a> fortunately advised by <a href="https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s37/lxs2/main.psp">Prof. Xuesong Lu</a> and <a href="https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s37/dqw/main.psp">Prof. Qiwen Dong</a>, focusing on Natural Language Processing and Data Mining.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, my research interest focuses on <strong>Foundation Model and Multi-Modal Reasoning</strong>. My goal is to empower multi-modal models with reasoning capabilities to solve complex real-world problems like human.
  
    </p>
    <p>
        Recently, I have proposed a knowledge-guided foundation model for network traffic classification and generation tasks, which is still under review. 
        Besides, I am actively working on multi-modal reasoning, any collaboration is welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>I am open to various forms of research collaboration.</strong> I am also open to any questions and discussions on ML, NLP and LLM. Feel free to leave any comments or send me an <a href="mailto:xiaochanglilxc@gmail.com">email</a>! Looking forward to hear from you!
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy watching good movies, and listening to music during my spare time. Besides, I like sports, including playing basketball, weight lifting, skiing and so on.
